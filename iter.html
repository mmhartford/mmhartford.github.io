        <h3>Clothing Resale Design for Startup Curtsy</h3>
        <p>Our group will design a web app for the startup Curtsy. Curtsy is a clothing marketplace focused on the concept of buying and selling clothing in rotation between its users. Targeting consumers with modern buying habits and a rotating wardrobe, Curtsy provides its users the opportunity to conveniently sell their old wardrobe to fund a new one.</p>
        <h3>Describe Lo-fi</h3>
        <p>like what's up with these mockups?</p>
        <h3>Include Lo-fi</h3>
        <p>Hopefully all same size</p>
        <h3>Hi-fi Prototype</h3>
        <p>How to include as image?</p>
        <p>In this particular high fidelity redesign, we wanted to focus on the match between our system and the real world, consistency and standards, and the flexibility and efficiency of design while maintaining a functional minimalist and aesthetic design. One of the major elements we sought to redesign was the way items were categorized and viewed within the product list. We found that we needed a consistent method of allowing users to filter their results within the product list. As a result, we decided on the ability to add and remove tags within different sets of filters that would appear fluid and consistent across different filters. Moreover, to increase the clarity of the actual product list, we decided to create four equal height columns with numerous rows that would feature the same size images and the same amount of text across the different products. We also wanted to create a home page reminiscent of many other clothing store homepages that users would be familiar with i.e. a banner type design with scrolling subcategories and explore categories below it. Lastly, in an effort to take into account critique feedback regarding Curtsy’s role as a user-based marketplace, we added buttons on the top menu bar that would make it clear that users are able to buy and sell other user products. The overall redesign iterated over several ideas from the sketches including pop-up screens to streamline the shopping cart and checkout tasks as well as to include common marketplace elements and screens from our previous sketches.</p>
        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p>We hypothesized that most users would start their experience using the "Featured" button. Each of the three users actually navigated away from the home page using different buttons. User 1 selected the "Featured" button, User 2 selected "Explore," and User 3 selected a category. If the goal of the site's home page is to allow users to interact with the site in a variety of ways, then the results imply a success. However, if one of the goals of the site's home page is to attract users to certain "featured" products, then the current design seems to be unsuccessful at doing so. That said, with a sample size of 3 we can only speculate.
        </p>
        <h3>Potential Changes</h3>
        <p>We should delete the underline on the tag headings which led users to believe the categories were clickable. We might also change the categories on the menu bar to include common tags which would forward users to the explore page with tags already selected (e.g. ‘pants’). User 2 suggested we add a sale category to the menu bar which we liked. Users seemed to forget they were buying second hand clothing as discussed above. A potential solution to this to this might be giving some visual cues that the item they’ve selected is a single garment. Perhaps non-stock photos would help convey this, maybe also a less sterile while background.</p>
        <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>Or is that even important?</p>
